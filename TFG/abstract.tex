The quick development that quantum computing is having in the latest years is opening the usage of his algorithms. But, this is generating new questions such as how we are going to programm or prove the correctness of this algorithms which are getting a lot more complex over time. We will introduce metamorphic testing as one of the testing methods that it will support us to achieve this goal.
