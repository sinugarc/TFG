The quick development that quantum computing has been experiencing in recent years is opening up the usage of its algorithms. However, this is generating new questions, such as how we are going to program or prove the correctness of these algorithms, which are becoming increasingly complex over time. We will introduce metamorphic testing as one of the testing methods to support us in achieving this goal.
