The quick development that quantum computing has been experiencing in recent years, both in terms of the number of qubits in quantum systems and their reliability,  it is opening up the usage of its algorithms. However, this raises new questions, such as how we are going to program or prove the correctness of these algorithms, which are becoming increasingly complex over time.\newline

This is where we introduce metamorphic testing as one of the testing methods to support us in achieving this goal. Throughout this document, we will explore the study of metamorphic rules for these algorithms, as well as the implementation and the use of metamorphic testing for fault detection.
